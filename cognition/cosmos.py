# COSMOS

'''
 1. mapping cognitive abilities across multiple conversations/models, 
 2. discovering novel combinations of cognitive abilities for thinking about unsolved problems, 
 3. minimum infrastructure enabling local/collaborative development - assume open source
'''

'''
Core Framework: COSMOS (Cognitive Open-Source Meta-Operating System)
COSMOS provides a unifying abstraction layer for working with advanced cognitive capabilities across diverse AI systems. It's designed to be:

Simple: Accessible to researchers and developers with various backgrounds
Modular: Components can be developed independently and composed flexibly
Observable: Cognitive processes can be monitored and measured
Scalable: Works across individual models to distributed systems
Meta-cognitive: Supports reflection on cognitive processes themselves

# 2. Discovering Novel Combinations for Unsolved Problems
# - exploration_process: 
# * solutions are found through a journey-like experience                 *
# * i think this conceptually is a more useful picture than combinatorics *
# * maybe because high-enough-d combinatorics r low-d?                    *
# need multiplier
