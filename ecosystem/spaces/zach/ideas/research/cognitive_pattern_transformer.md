## Core Research Focus: Cognitive Pattern Transformer

Building on transformer architecture, but fundamentally reimagining it around pattern recognition across cognitive domains rather than just sequence prediction. The key components would include:

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Embedding Space

Rather than embedding tokens in a linear sequence, I'd develop a system that embeds patterns in a multi-dimensional space where:

- Dimensions correspond to different cognitive domains (sensory, conceptual, emotional, etc.)
- Relationships between patterns are preserved across transformations
- Embeddings capture isomorphic structures across seemingly unrelated domains

### 2. Pattern Attention Mechanisms

Redesigning attention mechanisms to identify resonance between patterns:

- Dynamic weighting based on pattern similarity rather than just sequential relevance
- Cross-domain attention to identify similar patterns in different fields
- Recursive attention that can process self-referential patterns

### 3. Pattern Composition Engine

Creating mechanisms for combining patterns to generate novel insights:

- Operations for pattern blending, transformation, and synthesis
- Formal grammar for pattern composition and decomposition
- Evaluation metrics for pattern coherence and utility

### 4. Dataset Construction

Developing specialized datasets that capture pattern relationships:

- Parallel corpus of solutions to similar problems across different domains
- Annotated examples of pattern transformations and their outcomes
- Human-validated pattern similarity judgments

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pattern Language Formalization

Mathematically formalize TopoGlyph elements, their relationships, and operations

### Phase 2: Proof-of-Concept Model

Build small-scale model demonstrating basic pattern recognition and transformation

### Phase 3: Integration with Existing Transformer Architectures

Extend models like GPT/BERT with pattern-oriented components

### Phase 4: Full CPT Architecture

Develop complete architecture with all components

### Phase 5: Real-World Testing

Apply to problems in scientific discovery, design, and knowledge synthesis

## Potential Applications

This would create a system capable of:

1. Cross-domain innovation - identifying how solutions in one field could apply to another
2. Meta-pattern discovery - recognizing higher-order patterns that organize knowledge
3. Generative knowledge synthesis - creating novel combinations of existing patterns
4. Intuitive explanation generation - translating complex concepts through pattern analogies
5. Predicting emerging knowledge structures - forecasting how fields might evolve

What makes this approach distinctly different from current ML research is its focus on pattern structures rather than just statistical relationships, and its explicit modeling of cross-domain translations rather than treating each domain as a separate problem space.

The ultimate goal would be a system that can "think" in patterns the way humans do, but across a much wider range of domains and at scales beyond human capacity.
