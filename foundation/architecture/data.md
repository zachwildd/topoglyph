## Data Architecture: Living Knowledge Graph

graph database as ecosystem (neo4j or similar)

**1. Graph Database as Ecosystem: Use Neo4j or similar graph database with**:

- Nodes that strengthen with use and weaken with neglect
- Relationships that evolve based on traversal patterns
- Properties that adapt to changing contexts

**2. Regenerative Data Structures:**

- Implement "energy flows" where attention to one area feeds connected areas
- Use probabilistic data structures that allow for emergence and uncertainty
- Build self-healing indices that reorganize based on usage patterns

**3. Symbiotic Caching:**

- Cache data based on community benefit, not just individual usage
- Implement "nutrient cycling" where access patterns benefit the whole system
- Design "mycelial networks" where underused connections periodically activate to ensure system-wide health
