## Frontend Architecture: Wisdom Interface

1. **Component Ecology:**

- Design components that adapt to usage contexts
- Implement "companion planting" where components enhance each other
- Create UI elements that reveal relationships and connection

2. **State Management as Adaptive System:**

- Use state management patterns that mirror natural systems (Redux as ecosystem)
- Implement "memory" across sessions that learns from user journeys
- Design data flows that reveal rather than hide interdependencies

3. **Rendering as Living Canvas:**

- Create animations that follow organic rather than mechanical patterns
- Implement visualization techniques that reveal system health
- Design interfaces that encourage exploration and discovery
