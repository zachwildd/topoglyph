## 1. Regenerative Code Architecture:

```
⦗✿⦘ ⟿ ⦗Code Architecture⦘
```

Biomimetic Design Patterns:

Implement "forest-like" module structures with diverse interdependent components
Use composable micro-libraries that can be combined in emergent ways
Design interfaces that reveal their relationships to other components

Living Documentation:

Create documentation that evolves with usage patterns
Implement "desire paths" where user confusion autogenerates documentation needs
Design self-documenting systems that reveal their own structure

Evolutionary Testing:

Build tests that evolve with the codebase
Implement "environmental stress tests" that simulate diverse conditions
Design test coverage that focuses on ecosystem health, not just percentage

## 2. Love-Based Collaboration Patterns

```
⦗❤⦘ ⟿ ⦗Development Collaboration⦘
```

Implementation Patterns:

Contribution Recognition Architecture:

Design git workflows that value diverse contributions
Implement attribution systems beyond just code commits
Create visibility for nurturing and supportive work

Code Review as Care Work:

Frame code reviews as nurturing rather than judging
Implement review patterns that strengthen all participants
Design feedback systems that honor the author's intent

Inclusive Technical Practices:

Build accessibility into the architecture from day one
Implement internationalization as core respect for diversity
Design systems that work across device and connectivity constraints

## 3. Wisdom-Oriented Technical Decisions

```
⦗⚘⦘ ⟿ ⦗Technical Decision Making⦘
```

Implementation Patterns:

Value-Aligned Technology Choices:

Select technologies based on alignment with regenerative values
Implement stacks that honor both tradition and innovation
Design architecture that allows for evolution without disruption

Appropriate Technology Approach:

Choose the simplest solution that honors the problem's complexity
Implement technologies that empower rather than replace human judgment
Design systems that reveal their own workings rather than black boxes

Long-Term Thinking:

Build with consideration for future maintainers
Implement practices that consider ecological impact
Design architectures that can gracefully evolve or decompose
