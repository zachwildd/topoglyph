So I am trying to imagine a really creative concept for a game, and would like your help in imagining it. Before I tell you about the game, I would like to tell you some things about myself:

For reference, I am a programmer - have been since I was a kid, and I love the feeling of using neovim. Additionally, the other tool I love the most is my debugger and how it helps me understand and modify software.

Aside from being a programmer, I love multiplayer video games - especially ones which enable you to cultivate communities on servers. For example, when I was a kid - I loved playing Garry's Mod, especially when I found servers with lots of fun people who I would play with on a recurring basis.

But enough about me, the concept is something that feels like a combination of:

- Dwarf Fortress: incredible depth and complexity, makes nearly maximum use of the information density you can display with just ASCII, creative use of layering for managing the navigation of complexity
- Factorio: elegant features for collaboratively or individually creating/interacting with automated processes and systems
- Neovim: programmable ide, elegant/efficient keyboard usage, terminal-native interface
- Garry's Mod: community servers that people can visit, come back to, & cultivate online communities, workshop for sharing creations/extensions between people

With the constraint:

- All data is persisted in a universal knowledge graph
- All operations are transformation on this graph
- All interfaces are projections of this graph
