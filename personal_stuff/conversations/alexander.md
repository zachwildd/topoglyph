Apologies for taking so long to response, got myself stuck in a loop for a bit!

Still trying to solidify my understanding of what you said, and my perspective on it: 
- at the moment my intention is to create a sort of ‘hyper bridge’, which doesn’t just map two specific philosophies - but functions 

At the moment what I am immediately creating is more like an ‘everything app’ for thinking, creating, sharing, and interacting with people + artificial intelligences + their creations
