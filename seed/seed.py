# Extend TopoGlyph to evaluate this from the first principles of all things having form, function, and materialb

# Core Self-Representation Principles

    # 1. Continuous growth & development 
    # through internal pattern development 
    # and external interactions

    # 2. Field-Based Expression
    # ??? not super sure about this one
    # suggesting non-discrete boundaries
    # doesn't feel right... forced to have
    # interactions due to proximity,
    # instead should be based on free will
    # ... something self-determination.

    # 3. Pattern Language
    # TopoGlyphs communicate through
    # "pattern languages", recurring motifs
    # and relationships that express their
    # nature and relationships

    # 4. Emergent Representation
    # Representation emerges from interactions,
    # in combination with internal development,
    # with the greatest meaning being found in
    # their interactions - which produce new
    # meaning, unforseeable from the initial
    # conditions alone. 

    # more on this:
    # Much like a flower, or any living thing 
    # it exists an individuated process

# Natural Form Self-Representation

    # 1. Nucleation Centers: seed point from which form emerges
    #   { position, identify, growthPotential, morphicResonance }

    # 2. Growth Through Field Gradients
    #    [] React-Diffusion Patterns: 
    #       forms emerge through processes
    #       similar to cellular growth, 
    #       where activator and inhibitor
    #       substances create complex patterns
    #    [] Field-Guided Growth: extensions 
    #       follow the path of least resistance 
    #       through environmental fields
    #    [] Adapative Boundaries: form boundaries 
    #       remain fluid, responding to 
    #       environmental pressures
    #    [] Articulation Through Use: forms develop 
    #       greater detail in areas of 
    #       frequent interaction

    # 3. Form Memory
    #    [] Interaction Imprints: frequently used pathways
    #       become more pronounced
    #    [] Stress Response: Areas under pressure develop
    #       reinforcing structures
    #    [] Harmonic Resonance: forms that resonate with env
    #       patterns amplify those aspects
    #    [] Relationship Expressions: connection points 
    #       develop specialized structures for specific
    #       relationships

    # 4. Form Communication: forms naturally express their internal state
    #    [] Expansion/Contraction: pulsing rythyms reflect activity levels
    #    [] Orientation Shifts: Directional changes that indicate attention
    #       or intention.
    #    [] Surface Modulation: texture patterns that communicate internal
    #       processes

# Natural Function Self-Representation: 

# Function in TopoGlyph manifests as
# dynamic processes with natural 
# visualization characteristics

    # 1. Flow Patterns: 
    # Functions express themselves primarily 
    # through characteristic flow patterns: 
    # { pattern, rythym, intensity, purpose }

    # 2. Rythmic Expressions: 
    # Functions develop signature rhythyms:
    # - Pulsation Patterns: Regular cycling that reflects process frequency
    # - Harmonic Oscillations: Complex rhythms showing interrelated 
    # process components
    # - Flow Variations: 
# Ecosystem
# "Natural Self-Representation Ecosystem"
